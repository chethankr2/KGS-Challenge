Challenge #3

We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.
Example Inputs
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a

 

## First things first - Why Node?

>Node is just a javascript code that doesn't have strongly typed data structures, which makes it hard and every fucntion input needs to be validated before doing any compute on it.
